            # Project DFE

            I started another project called [Discover Focus Engage](https://dfe.social), or short: DFE.

            DFE's goal is oldschool: bring people together in the to start meaningful projects. Or put differently:
            fight intellectual loneliness.

            As a first subgoal I want to make discovery as fast and easy as possible, assuming it leads to more
            connections.
            That means not having to jump between clients when wanting to sift through different feeds.
            That also means easy ways to filter and bookmark.
            I also try to remove distractions. That is why there are no pictures and all statuses have the same height.

            As a second subgoal I do not want to deal with a catastrophe like Twitter again, and do not want others to,
            either.
            So most data is not saved on my server, but in your Mastodon account. This way you can keep all your
            Bookmarks, Filters
            and Hashtags even when leaving DFE.
            This is also why I stay away from closed social networks.
            In fact at the moment you can only ever process your bookmarks in another client. It will probably remain
            like this for
            a while, mostly due to time constraints.

            Third subgoals: Money, Data, Open Source.
            I want to earn money with this at some time, even would like to build a company on top of it.
            I haven't put too much thought into monetization though. It will probably be either premium features and/or
            aggregated
            (as in not personally identifiable) data analytics.
            It will be a hard but hopefully not unsolvable problem to keep monetization compatible with the goal of
            helping people
            to fight intellectual loneliness.

            Anyway thinking about monetization makes little sense with 10 users (that ever signed in).
